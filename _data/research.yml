page_intro: |
  I use experimental methods to study persuasive chatbots and social support in digital health contexts.
  My work examines how communication technology shapes health perceptions and behaviors.
  I focus on three key areas: medicalization through technology, user agency in digital health spaces,
  and the persuasive effects of AI on health-related decision-making.
