## Research Focus

Interpersonal relationships are, in large measure, defined and sustained by various consequential conversations people engage in. We argue to resolve conflict, seek and convey support, and gain and resist compliance. These conversations both reflect and have the potential to alter the nature of the relationships in which they occur.

## Key Questions

- How do conflict conversations shape relationship quality over time?
- What makes social support effective in close relationships?
- How do compliance-gaining strategies affect relationship dynamics?
- What role do emotions play in consequential conversations?

## Methods

My program of research examines the **cognitive**, **affective**, and **behavioral** aspects of conversations in close relationships through:

- Longitudinal survey studies
- Experimental designs
- Physiological measures (e.g., cortisol, heart rate variability)
- Multilevel structural equation modeling
- Dynamic dyadic systems analysis
