My research program examines how communication shapes relationships, well-being, and social change. I draw on experimental methods, longitudinal surveys, physiological measures, and computational approaches to understand the cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects of consequential conversations.

## Research Areas

I focus on three interconnected areas:

### [Communication and Close Relationships](/research/close-relationships/)
Interpersonal relationships are defined and sustained by consequential conversations. I examine the cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects of conversations in close relationships—from conflict resolution to social support.

### [Dynamic Communication Processes](/research/dynamic-processes/)
Communication produces changes in conversation partners and audiences. I use longitudinal methods, multilevel modeling, and dynamic dyadic systems approaches to characterize causal processes underlying communication experiences.

### [Addressing Challenges to Human Well-Being](/research/human-wellbeing/)
My work examines how communication patterns affect health outcomes, health disparities, and climate action. This includes provider-patient communication and persuasive messaging for social good.

## Collaboration

I welcome collaborations on health communication, interpersonal communication, and computational methods. I am particularly interested in interdisciplinary projects that combine communication theory with innovative methodologies.
