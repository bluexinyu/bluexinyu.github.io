I use experimental methods to study persuasive chatbots and social support in digital health contexts. My work examines how communication technology shapes health perceptions and behaviors.

## Current Projects

### Mental Health Medicalization on Social Media

I examine how social media platforms shape mental health perceptions and behaviors. My work focuses on self-diagnosis practices, validation seeking, and stigma formation in communities discussing ADHD, depression, and anxiety disorders.

### Social Support in Online Health Communities

I explore how people seek and receive support in digital health spaces. My research examines communities addressing stigmatized health issues, studying self-disclosure patterns, anonymity effects, and peer support dynamics.

### Youth Health Risk Behaviors on Digital Platforms

I investigate how teenagers discuss health risk behaviors on social media. My work analyzes substance use narratives, emotional expressions, and framing strategies using computational methods to study large-scale Reddit discussions.

### AI Chatbots in Health Communication

I study how persuasive AI influences health-related decisions and behaviors. My experimental work examines chatbot design features, persuasive strategies, trust formation, and user agency with AI health advisors.

## Collaboration

I welcome collaborations on health communication, AI ethics, and digital wellbeing research. I am particularly interested in interdisciplinary projects that combine communication theory with computational methods.
