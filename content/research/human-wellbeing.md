## Research Focus

Outside of a focus on the well-being of close relationships, my research has examined how patterns of provider-patient communication can improve patient outcomes, as well as how it may manifest and potentially exacerbate health disparities. In addition, in work funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, I have examined the effects of visual features of persuasive messages in promoting climate action.

## Key Questions

- How can provider-patient communication reduce health disparities?
- What communication patterns improve patient health outcomes?
- How do persuasive messages promote pro-environmental behavior?
- What role does visual design play in health message effectiveness?

## Research Areas

### Health Communication
- Provider-patient interaction patterns
- Health disparities and communication equity
- Patient-centered communication
- Health literacy and message design

### Digital Health
- Mental health discourse on social media
- AI chatbots in health decision-making
- Online health communities
- Youth health risk behaviors on digital platforms

### Environmental Communication
- Visual persuasion for climate action
- Message framing for pro-environmental behavior
- Science communication and public engagement
- Funded by Swiss National Science Foundation
