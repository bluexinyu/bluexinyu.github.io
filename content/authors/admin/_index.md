I am a Ph.D. student in Communication Studies at Michigan State University, advised by Dr. Yoo Jung (Erika) Oh. My research uses experimental methods to study persuasive chatbots and social support in digital health contexts.

My work examines how communication technology shapes health perceptions and behaviors. I focus on three key areas: medicalization through technology, user agency in digital health spaces, and the persuasive effects of AI on health-related decision-making.

My research has been published in *Journal of Medical Internet Research*, *Archives of Sexual Behavior*, *Computers in Human Behavior*, *new media & society*, and *Sex Education*.
