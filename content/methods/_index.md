I employ diverse research methods to study communication technology and health.

## Experimental Methods

I design experiments to test causal relationships between communication variables. My experimental work focuses on persuasive AI and health messaging effects.

**Skills**: Experimental design, hypothesis testing, random assignment, manipulation checks

## Computational Methods

I use computational techniques to analyze large-scale digital communication data. My work involves natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and machine learning.

**Skills**: Python (NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn), R (tidyverse, tm, quanteda), topic modeling, sentiment analysis

## Survey Research

I conduct surveys to measure attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions using validated scales from communication and psychology research.

**Skills**: Questionnaire design, Qualtrics, sampling strategies, reliability testing

## Qualitative Methods

I employ qualitative methods to understand communication meanings and processes, including thematic analysis and in-depth interviewing.

**Skills**: Thematic analysis, interviewing, content analysis, grounded theory

## Statistical Analysis

I use advanced statistical techniques including regression modeling, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling.

**Skills**: SPSS, R, Stata, regression analysis, factor analysis, SEM, mediation/moderation analysis
