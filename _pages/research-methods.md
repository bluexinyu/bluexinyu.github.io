## Research Methodologies

I employ diverse research methods to study communication technology and health. My methodological approach combines experimental design, computational analysis, and qualitative inquiry. I believe methodological rigor enhances our understanding of complex communication phenomena.

### Experimental Methods

I design experiments to test causal relationships between communication variables. My experimental work focuses on persuasive AI and health messaging effects. I manipulate message features and measure behavioral and attitudinal outcomes. I employ both laboratory and online experimental designs.

**Key Skills:**
- Experimental design and hypothesis testing
- Random assignment and control procedures
- Manipulation checks and attention measures
- Statistical power analysis

### Computational Methods

I use computational techniques to analyze large-scale digital communication data. My work involves natural language processing and sentiment analysis. I apply machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in health discussions. I combine automated analysis with human coding for validation.

**Key Skills:**
- Python programming (NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn)
- R programming (tidyverse, tm, quanteda)
- Topic modeling (LDA, STM)
- Sentiment analysis and emotion detection
- Social network analysis

### Survey Research

I conduct surveys to measure attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions. My surveys employ validated scales from communication and psychology research. I use online platforms for efficient data collection. I apply rigorous sampling and weighting procedures.

**Key Skills:**
- Questionnaire design and scale development
- Online survey implementation (Qualtrics)
- Sampling strategies
- Reliability and validity testing

### Qualitative Methods

I employ qualitative methods to understand communication meanings and processes. My qualitative work includes thematic analysis of online discussions. I conduct interviews to explore individual experiences and perspectives. I use grounded theory approaches for theory development.

**Key Skills:**
- Thematic analysis
- In-depth interviewing
- Content analysis
- Grounded theory procedures

### Statistical Analysis

I use advanced statistical techniques to analyze communication data. My analyses include regression modeling, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. I employ appropriate techniques for different data types and research questions.

**Key Skills:**
- SPSS, R, and Stata
- Regression analysis (OLS, logistic, multilevel)
- Factor analysis and SEM
- Mediation and moderation analysis
- Time series analysis

## Current Methodological Projects

I am currently developing methods for analyzing AI-generated health content. I am exploring ways to detect persuasive strategies in chatbot conversations. I am working on automated classification of social support messages. These methodological innovations will advance health communication research.

## Methodological Training

I have completed graduate coursework in research methods, statistics, and computational analysis. I have attended workshops on experimental design and natural language processing. I continue to develop my methodological skills through hands-on research projects. I am committed to methodological excellence in communication scholarship.
