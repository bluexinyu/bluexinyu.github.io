I am a Ph.D. student in Communication Studies at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu), advised by [Dr. Yoo Jung (Erika) Oh](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/yoo-jung-erika-oh). My research uses experimental methods to study persuasive chatbots and social support in digital health contexts.

Methodologically, I conduct controlled experiments and analyze large-scale digital data using Python and R for natural language processing and statistical modeling.

My work examines how persuasive chatbots influence health decision-making and how online communities provide social support for health-related challenges. I focus on understanding these processes among vulnerable populations including women and young people.

My research has been published in *Journal of Medical Internet Research*, *Archives of Sexual Behavior*, *Computers in Human Behavior*, *new media & society*, and *Sex Education*. I have received the Top Paper Award from the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.
