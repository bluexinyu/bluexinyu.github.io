## Welcome!

I'm **Xinyu Zhang**, a Ph.D. student in Communication Studies at Michigan State University, working under the supervision of Dr. Oh Yoo Jung. My research sits at the intersection of communication technology, artificial intelligence, and health communication, with a particular focus on how digital platforms shape health-seeking behaviors and social support processes.

## Research Interests

My work explores several interconnected areas:

- **Platform Diagnosis and Algorithmic Pseudo-diagnosis**: Investigating how users interact with AI-driven diagnostic tools and the communication patterns that emerge around digital health platforms
- **Trust in AI-Driven Self-Diagnosis**: Examining the factors that influence trust in artificial intelligence for health decisions and their implications for health outcomes  
- **Women's Health and Health Message Design**: Focusing on gender-specific health communication needs and designing effective health messaging for women
- **Social Support and Sexual Identity**: Understanding how online communities provide support around sensitive topics related to sexual identity and feminism
