## About

I am a Ph.D. student in Communication Studies at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu), advised by [Dr. Yoo Jung (Erika) Oh](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/yoo-jung-erika-oh). My research uses experimental methods to study persuasive chatbots and social support in digital health contexts.

My research stands out in three key ways within the field of communication technology and well-being. First, I explore how communication technology can contribute to medicalization, particularly focusing on how it can exacerbate addiction and anxiety. This involves studying the role of technology in shaping public perceptions of health and fostering medical mistrust and misinformation. Second, I concentrate on the user's agency in adopting communication technology, examining how individuals make choices and exert control in the digital space, and how this impacts their well-being. Finally, I am interested in investigating the impact of persuasive AI on human perceptions and behaviors.

My research has been published in *Journal of Medical Internet Research*, *Archives of Sexual Behavior*, *Computers in Human Behavior*, *new media & society*, and *Sex Education*. I have received the Top Paper Award from the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.
