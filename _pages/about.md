I am a Ph.D. student in Communication Studies at the [Department of Communication, College of Communication Arts and Sciences, Michigan State University](https://comm.msu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Oh Yoo Jung](https://comm.msu.edu/our-people/faculty/oh-yoo-jung.html). My research primarily lies at the intersection of **computational communication**, **health communication**, and **persuasive AI**, with a focus on how digital platforms and AI-driven systems shape health-seeking behaviors, social support processes, and decision-making around sensitive health topics.

Methodologically, I specialize in analyzing human behavior through large-scale digital footprint data using mixed-methods computational approaches. I am proficient in Python and highly skilled in R, particularly for applications in natural language processing, social network analysis, and statistical modeling of online health communities.

As a computational communication researcher, I investigate how **persuasive AI** and algorithmic systems influence health communication, particularly in vulnerable populations. My work examines the complex dynamics of *trust*, *social support*, *identity formation*, and *behavioral change* in digital health environments. I am particularly interested in understanding how AI-driven platforms affect health decision-making processes among women, young people, and marginalized communities.

My research portfolio spans several interconnected areas: **digital health communication** (substance use discussions, antidepressant perceptions, sexual health education), **social support mechanisms** in online communities (infertility support, pornography abstinence forums), and **identity and intimacy** in digital spaces (astrology sensemaking, feminist identity formation). Through computational methods, I trace how these elements reveal the evolving dynamics of people's health behaviors and their interactions with persuasive technologies.

My work has been published in leading journals, including *Journal of Medical Internet Research*, *Archives of Sexual Behavior*, *Computers in Human Behavior*, *new media & society*, *JMIR Formative Research*, and *Sex Education*. My research has been recognized with the **Top Paper Award** from the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication: Commission on the Status of Women.
